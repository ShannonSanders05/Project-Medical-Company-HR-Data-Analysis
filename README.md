## Project Title: Project-Medical-Company-HR-Data-Analysis

**Description**:

Working as a data analyst team for the HR department in a medical company.
The data provided by the HR department includes 10-15 parameters per day per year
(arrival/departure time, vacations, sick days, time off, etc) on 1000+ employees
of the company. My task was to answer the following questions, which
the CEO formulated:

1. Identify the most disciplined and undisciplined employees and divisions;

2. Create a visualization with the analysis of weekdays and months when
most employees were late/absent (either for vacation or sick leave);

3. Which heads of departments tend to forgive
employees for lack of discipline? Are there any favorites for any heads of
departments?
